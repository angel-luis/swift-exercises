## Overview

More than 50 Swift exercises solved by me using `Swift 5.9` (ðŸš§ still in progress).Check out the original source: [Weekly Challenge 2022 Swift](https://github.com/mouredev/Weekly-Challenge-2022-Swift).

## Usage

For Windows platforms using PowerShell, provide the number of the exercise in the following command.

```powershell
.\execute.ps1 -exercise 1
```

For other platforms, just grab the `swift` file of each exercise folder and compile with your platform tools.
